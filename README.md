# LowContrastComplications

To [aid in the legibility](https://david-smith.org/blog/2018/10/05/considering-low-contrast-complications/) of the time on the Infograph Analog watch face in watchOS 5 I've made myself a set of low contrast alternatives to the system complications that I find dramatically improve reading the time. 

This project includes the two of these that are easiest to share since they do not rely on any external mechanism or data provider.  These are the __Date__ and __Battery__ complications. 

I'm sharing these so that if anyone else is interested in trying this setup out they can.  The code is kinda horrible and no where near what a 'finalized' version would look like but they mostly work.  Because of limitations with how complications can update, the battery complication only updates every 15 minutes or so.  

I'm not expecting to update, support or manage these examples going forward, but am instead just providing them in case they are interesting from someone else to try out.
